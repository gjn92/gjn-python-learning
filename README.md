## Introduction

I embarked on this journey to learn Python as part of my broader goal to become proficient in cybersecurity. Python's versatility and power make it an ideal language for developing cybersecurity tools, automating tasks, and analyzing data. This repository documents my progress as I learn Python, complete exercises, and work on projects that are relevant to cybersecurity.

## Goals

- **Develop Python Proficiency**: Gain a strong foundation in Python programming, focusing on skills relevant to cybersecurity.
- **Support Cybersecurity Training**: Use Python to automate tasks, analyze data, and create security tools to support my cybersecurity studies and future career.
- **Build a Portfolio**: Showcase my learning journey and projects to potential employers and peers in the cybersecurity field.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Document my learning process, reflect on challenges, and keep updating my skills.

## Learning Topics

This repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific topic or area of study:

1. **Basics**: Fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control flow.
2. **Data Structures**: Working with lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and more.
3. **Algorithms**: Basic algorithms including sorting, searching, and others.
4. **Cybersecurity Applications**: Scripts and projects specifically focused on cybersecurity, such as network scanning, data encryption, and log analysis.
5. **Projects**: Mini-projects to apply what I've learned in practical scenarios.
6. **Exercises**: Various coding exercises and challenges to reinforce learning.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **Network Scanner**: A Python script to scan a network and identify active devices, demonstrating the use of Python for network security tasks.
- **Password Strength Checker**: A script to evaluate the strength of passwords, including checking against common patterns and dictionary attacks.
- **Web Scraper**: A script to scrape data from websites and process it, showing how to gather information using Python.

Each project has its own folder with a detailed README file explaining the project, how to run it, and what I learned from it.
